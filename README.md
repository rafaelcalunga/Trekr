#  Trekr

This project is an app that displays some information based on locations on a map.

I made this project to improve my knowledge in iOS development, specially SwiftUI.

This app was made following the tutorial by Paul Hudson [available here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aP-SQXTtWhY)

As well as helping absolute beginners learn some SwiftUI, the livestream is also taking place in aid of Julian House â€“ a UK charity that provides support for vulnerable and at-risk individuals. These include men, women and young people experiencing homelessness, women and children escaping domestic abuse, adults with learning difficulties and people who need support after leaving prison.
